# mario64emojis
we have the entire mario 64 font as emojis in our discord server and we're lazy

[come see](https://erinamer.github.io/mario64emojis/)

#### TODO:
* currently the script adds a space after every emoji because i thought that was necessary but after some tests i've discovered that it isn't. so i will change that
* get all the emojis, put them in a nice little zip, and host them so everyone can know mario in their server
* get the punctuation and number emojis in there too. but those should be in their own folders within the zip depending on how much room your server has
* the natural consequence of the above: add checkboxes so people can choose how many things they want to convert
* learn how to make html/css bend to my will so:
  * there's a blurb explaining what the site does
  * the copy result button notifies the user that the text has been copied
  * the buttons are bigger and positioned properly
  * you can resize the input box
  * the mobile version actually looks good
